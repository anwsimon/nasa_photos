Welcome to the Cat Snaps App!

In this application you'll find a collection of photos (theoretically) taken by Felicette the cat. Felicette was the first cat ever in space. She safely returned via parachute in 1963.

You can "like" Felicette's snaps to let her know how much you appreciate her endeavors.
